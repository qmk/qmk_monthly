Hello, and welcome to the QMK Monthly, Issue 3!

First, we would like to welcome noroadsleft to the QMK Collaborator crew! We're so happy to have you. :)

Now, let's see what's new!

## Firmware

- Warning when firmware size is close to capacity (#[5485](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5485)) - written by mtei 
- Overhaul of RGB Matrix code (significant performance improvement) (#[5372](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5372)) written by XScorpion2/Xulkal 
- Massdrop boards (CTRL and ALT) switched to QMK Firmware’s RGB Matrix feature from custom implementation (#[5328](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5328)) - written by daniel5151 
- Debouncing: Eager Per Row debouncing added (ideal for boards with rotated matrices, like the Ergodox EZ) (#[5498](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5498)) written by alex-ong 
- Encoder support for Split keyboards (#[5477](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5477)) written by XScorpion2/Xulkal 
- Support for IS31FL3737 and tweaks to ARM Audio code (#[5532](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5532)) written by Jack Humbert 
- Combo feature improvements (global register and timer usage) (#[2561](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/2561)) written by rsheldiii 
- ATmega32a (BMC) boards updated to use i2c_master (#[5562](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5562) and #[4957](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4957)) written by MechMerlin 
- Per Key Tapping Term (allows you to specify different tapping term for each key) (#[5009](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5009)) written by drashna 
- Add AltGr support for SEND_STRING (#[4046](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/4046)) written by drashna 
- Add support for full range of keys (Extra/Media keys) for ATSAM (Massdrop CTRL and ALT keyboards) (#[5180](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5180)) written by drashna 
- Add support for “DIRECT_PIN” matrices (#[5091](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5091)) written by zvecr 
- Add WS2812 LED support for RGB Matrix (#[5418](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5418)) written by XScorpion2/Xulkal 
- Add new OLED Driver (AVR and ARM compatible) (#[5288](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5288)) written by XScorpion2/Xulkal 
    - This is faster, and faster than the existing SSD1306 OLED drivers, with some additional functionality (such as rotation support, and scrolling) 

- Improved functionality of RGB Lights over Split keyboards (#[5020](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5020), #[5509](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/5509)) written by mtei 
    - This enables synced animations over i2c, and for RGB Split support 

- Use a Hardware Timer for Software based PWM Backlighting for stability (#[3615](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/3615)) written by masterzen 


## Configurator

- Fast Input Mode (suggested by Jetpack) 
    - Instead of clicking on every key, just put configurator into fast input mode and continuously enter keys; The UI will highlight the next key after each keypress. 

- More graceful layer handling 
    - If a key has no active keys it is now considered empty by the UI 
    - When generating keymaps, we now handle intermediate empty layers correctly and send empty KC_TRNS layers to the API; this may result in keymaps which are too big. 

- Control Panel 
    - Toggle the Key Unit Display so you can see what key sizes a particular layout needs. 

- I18N foundation. It is now possible to translate the UI into other languages. 
    - Help wanted for Japanese, Chinese, German and French translations. 

- Misc 
    - Bug: Fixes to layer keycodes, bug in code that no-one triggered during import 
    - Bug: Factual fix to potato facts (Minjae Song) 
    - Bug: provide getter for firmwareFile (reported by e11i0t23) 
    - Bug: KC_APP not handled properly (fauxpark) 
    - Bug: DZ60 keymap right control fix (fauxpark) 
    - Romac default keymap (stanrc85) 
    - Bug: De-dupe key presses (introduced by ISO keyboard support) 
    - Satan Default keymap (fauxpark) 
    - New potato facts (edited by noroadsleft) 
    - Streamline font choices and use google fonts more consistently 
    - Steno for georgi (germ) 
    - Treadstone48 keymap (marksard) 
    - Signum 3.0 default keymap (jceb)
