# QMK Monthly Issue #7


## Announcements

 * Welcome _fauxpark_ to QMK collaborators. Fauxpark has made many contributions to the source code and documentation, improving maintainability and readability. He also helps maintain QMK toolbox, along with Drashna, and is one of the most active users on our discord, helping the community get the most out of QMK. Many thanks for all your hardwork and contributions.

## Firmware Updates

 * We have completed our first [Breaking Changes merge](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/issues/6146). During this process we merged [11 PR's](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pulls?q=label%3Afuture_2019q2+) and everything seems to have gone smoothly. Particularly notable is that [LUFA is now a submodule](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6245) and [all core code is formatted by clang-format now](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/6293).
